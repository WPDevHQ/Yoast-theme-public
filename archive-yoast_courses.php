				<h2>What every online SEO course contains</h2>
				<p>All of our SEO courses contain lots of training videos in which Joost de Valk and other Yoast experts
					explain the topic. Every SEO training challenges you to check whether or not you understood the
					material. At the end of each lesson, you’ll have to fill out a quiz. All of our courses are
					developed with the help of an educational specialist. For the SEO copywriting training, we worked
					together with a linguist.</p>

				<p>All of the Yoast courses contain high quality and state-of-the-art material. We update every course
					at least annually, making sure we’ll teach you the latest insights. We give practical tips that’ll
					really allow you to make improvements on any website!</p>

				<p>Every course comes with a certificate for you to show your (prospective) customers that you know what
					you're doing when it comes to SEO!</p>
